0.3.0 2022-05-15T21:58:03-07:00 America/Los_Angeles
 [DOCS]
 - document auto-generated accessor methods for standard attributes
 - reorganize POD docs to separate methods into subsections for class,
   auto-generated and instance methods
 - remove NAME section from source POD. I didn't notice until now that
   Pod::Weaver was adding a duplicate.

 [MINOR]
 - remove auto-generation of non-standard attribute accessor methods
   (writing docs, couldn't recommend using them)

 [REVISION]
 - add found_attrs() method with 100+ test cases

0.2.3 2022-05-15T00:46:55-07:00 America/Los_Angeles
 [DOCS]

 [REVISION]
 - add Dist::Zilla plugin Test::UnusedVars and fix one function which it
   flagged
 - update t/test-inputs/003_samples/gen-sample to regenerate sample data
   from all distros if no arguments
 - add more Open Source community distros recongized as common
 - update tests for sample os-release from opensuse/leap
 - add basic tests for import of singleton-management methods (just check
   if they landed)

0.2.0 2022-04-28T22:58:00-07:00 America/Los_Angeles
 [ENHANCEMENTS]
 - add import_singleton() so new module Sys::OsPackage can import rather than copy the singleton-management methods

0.1.1 2022-04-28T16:04:09-07:00 America/Los_Angeles
 [REVISION]
 - based on CPAN Testers feedback, remove occurrences of // operator which did not exist prior to Perl 5.10 (in keeping with module's minimal prerequisites)

 [BUG FIXES]
 - all methods now correctly handle being called via class name in addition to instance reference
 [MINOR]
 - prefixed "_" on private internal method names
 [REVISION]
 - added tests for method calls from the class name in addition to object reference

0.0.2 2022-04-26T23:22:00-07:00 America/Los_Angeles
 [BUG FIXES]
 - fix from CPAN Testers results: on mswin32 init empty rather than bail out
 [DOCS]

 [REVISION]
